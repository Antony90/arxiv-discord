# arXiv Chat: AI research assistant & Discord bot

## üìå About
- An AI chatbot agent designed to assist researchers and enthusiasts accessing and interacting with the [arXiv paper archive](https://arxiv.org/). Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5.

- The goal is to make the process of literature exploration more efficient and promotes critical discussions between multiple papers.

- As an autonomous agent, it can decompose user prompts into several tasks, removing the need to specifically request for tasks to be carried out. This makes use of OpenAI's [Function Calling API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).

- Built with [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html), [discord.py](discordpy.readthedocs.io/), [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction).

## üß™ Demo
Join the official discord [here](https://discord.gg/Y38bcWSzSD). ~~Invite the bot to your server~~. Coming soon.

## üí° Features

- **Querying Papers**
    - Ask questions about specific papers, arXiv-Chat will respond with appropriately cited responses.
- **Critical Discussions**
    - You can engage in discussions involving multiple papers asking comparative questions. Key arguments will be raised to facilitate an insightful conversation
- **Paper Summaries**
    - Summarize papers concisely, highlighting the main argument and conclusions. There are 3 variations: {laymans, keypoints, comprehensive} which are chosen based on preference and the level of detail required.
- **Paper Recommendation/Search**
    - arXiv-Chat may point you to specific papers based on your discussion. It can also simply search arXiv.

## üìú Planned Features

- **git Repository Loader**
    - The ability to clone in-paper git repo links, allowing their code to be part of the agent's accessible knowledge base. Could assist in understanding the implementation of a paper with code.
